## Objective

Design and implement a front-end for options strategy risk and reward analysis using Vue.

## Brief

The challenge is to create a Vue component that can generate a risk & reward graph for options strategies. The component should accept an input of up to four options contracts and output the following:
1. A risk & reward graph where X is the price of the underlying at the time of expiry and Y is the profit/loss at that price. 
2. Max profit, max loss, and all break even points.

### Features/Overview:

- Add multiple financial options to the same graph
- Max profit, max loss, visualization of break even points (low precision)
- check profit/loss according to underlying active price in a range
